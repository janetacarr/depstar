# Getting Started

> Note: you must have at least version 1.10.1.727 of the Clojure CLI installed! Version 1.10.3.933 is the latest stable version as of `depstar` 2.1.278. See [Clojure Tools Releases](https://clojure.org/releases/tools) for details about the functionality in recent CLI releases.

Add `depstar` via one or more aliases in your project `deps.edn` or user-level `deps.edn` (in `~/.clojure/` or `~/.config/clojure/`):

```clj
{
 :aliases {
  ;; build an uberjar (application) with AOT compilation by default:
  :uberjar {:replace-deps {com.github.seancorfield/depstar {:mvn/version "2.1.278"}}
            :exec-fn hf.depstar/uberjar
            :exec-args {:aot true}}
  ;; build a jar (library):
  :jar {:replace-deps {com.github.seancorfield/depstar {:mvn/version "2.1.278"}}
        :exec-fn hf.depstar/jar
        :exec-args {}}
 }
}
```

Create an uberjar by invoking `depstar` with the desired jar name:

```bash
clojure -X:uberjar :jar MyProject.jar
```

An uberjar created by that command can be run as follows:

```bash
java -cp MyProject.jar clojure.main -m project.core
```

If you want to be able to use `java -jar` to run your uberjar, you'll need to specify the main class (namespace) in the uberjar and you'll probably want to AOT compile your main namespace. See [Building an Application JAR](application-jar.md), and the [`:main-class`](main-class.md) and [AOT Compilation](aot.md) sections for more detail.

Create a (library) jar by invoking `depstar` with the desired jar name:

```bash
clojure -X:jar :jar MyLib.jar
```

> Note: if you have a `user.clj` file on your default classpath -- in any folders that are in `:paths` in your `deps.edn` -- Clojure will attempt to load that at startup, before running `depstar`. In such cases, you will likely need to add `:replace-paths []` along with `:replace-deps` in your aliases for `depstar`.

If you want to deploy a library to Clojars (or Maven Central), you're going to also need a `pom.xml` file -- see [`pom.xml`](pom-xml.md) for more details.
For deployment to Clojars, please read the [Clojars Verified Group Names policy](https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/Verified-Group-Names).

If you want to see all of the files that are being copied into the JAR file, add `:verbose true` after the JAR filename.
