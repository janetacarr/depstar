# Changes

**For the latest `:git/tag` of `depstar` and its matching `:git/sha`, see the [`depstar` releases page](https://github.com/seancorfield/depstar/releases) on GitHub.**

* v2.1.303 -- 2021-09-15
  * Fix #102 by converting certain options to strings _after_ alias lookup instead of _before_ (breakage introduced in 2.1.245).

* v2.1.297 9626e19 -- 2021-09-04
  * Support `:mvn/local-repo` directly as an option -- #100.
  * Clean up build/CI infrastructure, add Gitpod badge, update deps.

* v2.1.278 672c142 -- 2021-07-29
  * Strip out logging and use `println` instead (this makes it easier to play with other tools) -- #98.
  * Do not calculate a basis just to get the aliases -- only read and merge the EDNs -- #97.
  * Fix bad link in docs #95, and bad links in README.
  * Clarify tag/sha versions for `depstar`.

* v2.1.267 1a45f79 -- 2021-07-13
  * Address #87 by adding a new namespace `hf.depstar.api` containing `jar` and `uber` functions which are drop-in replacements for `tools.build.api` versions, but also accept all of the options that `depstar` supports to control the behavior in more detail. In addition, `hf.depstar/build` has been added as a component step to work with the existing `aot` and `pom` functions in that namespace.
  * The documentation has had a major overhaul (including addressing #93 by adding a **Terminology and Conventions** section!).

## Older Versions (w/o matching SHA)

* 2.1.253 -- 2021-07-11
  * Fix #94 by adding `:extra-deps` from `:aliases` to `:deps` used for `pom.xml` synchronization.

* 2.1.250 -- 2021-07-09
  * Add `:tools/usage` and instructions for new CLI `tools` support.
  * Update `clojure.tools.deps.alpha` and use its new `create-basis` function, instead of rolling my own.

* 2.1.245 -- 2021-06-27
  * Address #83 by explaining possible `Skipping paths` warning when `:sync-pom true`.
  * Address #82 by reorganizing the internals into three "tasks" so that `hf.depstar/aot` and `hf.depstar/pom` are exposed and can be run via the `-X` CLI option. In order to make those more useful as standalone tasks, a new `:target-dir` option has been added so you can generate `pom.xml` and/or `classes` into a specific directory.
  * Address #81 by batching compilation into a single process, with a `:compile-batch` option to use multiple processes if there are too many namespaces. @stefanroex
  * Address #80 by adding `:delete-on-exit true` exec arg so users can opt-in to early deletion of temporary files and directories, instead of relying on the O/S to clean them "eventually".
  * Address #74 by noting CI environment caching "gotchas".
  * Update `test-runner`.

* 2.0.216 -- 2021-04-14
  * Address #77 by noting the possible interaction of `user.clj` and `depstar` and suggesting `:replace-paths []`.
  * Fix #76 adjusting AOT selection logic (`:aot true` without `:main-class` gives a warning and does not attempt to compile anything).

* 2.0.211 -- 2021-03-31
  * Fix #75 by adding `:compile-aliases` so the classpath for AOT compilation can be adjusted separately from the classpath for JAR building (controlled by `:aliases`).
  * Update several dependency versions.

* 2.0.206 -- 2021-03-17
  * Address #73 by updating the documentation and adding a new `:paths-only` option (default `false`).
  * Fix #71 by allowing keyword-valued exec args to be looked up as aliases in the full basis (including user `deps.edn`).

* 2.0.193 -- 2021-03-02
  * Change coordinates to `com.github.seancorfield/depstar` (although new versions will continue to be deployed to `seancorfield/depstar` for a while -- see the [Clojars Verified Group Names policy](https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/Verified-Group-Names)).
  * Fix #70 by encouraging reverse domain names for group IDs in the README and adding a warning if `:group-id` is specified and does not contain at least one `.`.
  * Fix #69 by adding `:manifest` option to populate `MANIFEST.MF` file.

* 2.0.188 -- 2021-02-23
  * Fix #68 so `:compile-ns :all` works again (broken in 2.0.187).

* 2.0.187 -- 2021-02-20
  * **NOTE: `:compile-ns :all` is broken in this release!**
  * Allow `:compile-ns` to accept regex strings to match namespaces (as well as symbols). PR #67 @wandersoncferreira (bartuka)
  * Fix #66 by switching from "jar" processing to "zip" processing and using `.entries` instead of calling `.getNextEntry` (the latter checks CRCs, the former doesn't apparently).
  * Address #65 by ignoring `.DS_Store` files.
  * Fix #64 by adding a `:jvm-opts` exec argument for passing JVM options to the AOT compilation subprocess.
  * Fix #63 by adding a `:compile-fn` exec argument for passing in a custom `compile` function.

* 2.0.171 -- 2021-01-29
  * Fix #56 by requiring all of `:group-id`, `:artifact-id`, and `:version` when `:sync-pom true` and no `pom.xml` file is present (GAV are now required when you want `depstar` to create your `pom.xml` file).
  * Fix #59 by decoupling `pom.xml` file handling from `MANIFEST.MF` handling, which makes it possible to build an uberjar without a `pom.xml` file. This also allows you to specify `:aot true` and `:main-class` when building a (thin) JAR file -- but cautions you that it is not recommended!
  * Fix #60 by attempting to run `git rev-parse HEAD` (in the same directory as the `pom.xml`) and adding the output as `revision=` in `pom.properties`.
  * Address #61 by updating the **Classpath** section of the README (to clarify how the classpath is built and how to use `-Sdeps`).

* 2.0.165 -- 2020-12-28
  * Escape compile process arguments when shelling out on Windows. Fixes #57 via PR #58 (@borkdude).

* 2.0.161 -- 2020-12-23
  * Allow more formats of `<tag>` to be matched against the version, when synchronizing `:version`. Fixes #55.

* 2.0.160 -- 2020-12-22
  * `depstar` now behaves like a "tool" rather than a "library" -- you should use `:replace-deps` to specify it as a dependency rather than `:extra-deps` and it will compute the project basis from the system, user, and project `deps.edn` files using `clojure.tools.deps.alpha`. By default, it applies no aliases but you can specify an `:aliases` exec-arg with a vector of aliases to apply. By default, it behaves like the CLI's `-Srepro` option in that the user `deps.edn` file is ignored: specify `:repro false` if you want the user `deps.edn` file to be included in the basis. Fixes #47, #48, #49.
  * `:compile-ns` exec-arg supports a vector of namespaces to be compiled; this overrides `:aot` and `:main-class` and allows you to AOT-compile specific namespaces for inclusion in a thin JAR, if needed. Fixes #51.
  * The group/artifact IDs and the version can now be overridden by exec arguments (`:group-id`, `:artifact-id`, and `:version` respectively, and `depstar` will update your `pom.xml` file to match). Fixes #53.
  * `:sync-pom true` will automatically run the equivalent of `clojure -Spom`. See README for more details. Fixes #54.
  * The log4j2 plugins cache is now merged correctly. Fixes #50.
  * Supported entry points: `hf.depstar/jar` and `hf.depstar/uberjar` via `-X`, `hf.depstar.uberjar/build-jar` via REPL or library usage. The following legacy entry points are all deprecated: `hf.depstar.jar/-main`, `hf.depstar.jar/run`, `hf.depstar.uberjar/-main`, `hf.depstar.uberjar/run`, and `hf.depstar.uberjar/run*`.
  * Automated tests now exist, along with CI via GitHub Actions, against JDK versions 8, 11, 14, 15, 16-ea, and 17-ea. Fixes #26.

* 1.1.136 -- 2020-11-16
  * Fix #46 by adding `:pom-file` exec argument to specify a `pom.xml` file in a non-standard location, e.g., `:pom-file '"/tmp/pom.xml"'` -- there is no equivalent `:main-opts` flag for this, you have to use the CLI's `-X` invocation to supply it.

* 1.1.133 -- 2020-11-07
  * Fix #45 by providing a REPL-friendly/library entry point as `hf.depstar.uberjar/build-jar`. _[this was originally `hf.depstar.uberjar/run*`]_

* 1.1.132 -- 2020-10-19
  * Call `shutdown-agents` at the end of processing, to account for AOT of badly-behaved code that has side-effecting top-level forms.
  * Clarify, in the README, that Clojure CLI version 1.10.1.697 or later is assumed.

* 1.1.128 -- 2020-10-09
  * Fix #44 by changing how legal files are initially copied.

* 1.1.126 -- 2020-10-08
  * Fix #43 by changing `pom.properties` to use `=` instead of `:`.
  * Fix #42 by changing how `compile` failures are handled.
  * Fix #41 by including license and copyright notices; concatenates repeated files if they are not exact duplicates.

* 1.1.117 -- 2020-09-14
  * Fix #40 by making "suppress clash" the default; add `-D` / `--debug-clash` option to print the "clashing jar items" warnings.
  * Address #39 by issuing a warning if conflicting data readers are detected (`.cljc` data readers are not fully supported yet).
  * Address #38 by warning about multiple JAR file names (explaining which one is selected).
  * Streamline the `clojure -X` invocation entry points to `hf.depstar/jar` and `hf.depstar/uberjar`.

* 1.1.104 -- 2020-08-27
  * Fix #37 by adding `-X` / `--exclude` to provide one or more regex used to exclude files from the JAR.
  * Fix #35 by providing `hf.depstar/jar` and `hf.depstar/uberjar` as entry points that can be used by the Clojure CLI `-X` option (to execute a specific function and pass a map of arguments). _[these were originally `hf.depstar/jar` and `hf.depstar/uberjar`]_
  * Fix #34 by adding `-P` / `--classpath` option to specify a classpath to use (based on PR #36 @borkdude).
  * Fix #33 by allowing destination JAR filename to appear anywhere on the command-line as well as adding a `-J` / `--jar` option for it.
  * Address #31 by clarifying in the README that `(:gen-class)` is required for AOT.

* 1.0.97 -- 2020-08-05
  * Fix a bug in the workaround for `Log4j2Plugins.dat`.

* 1.0.96 -- 2020-07-29
  * Added a workaround for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-954 issue with `Log4j2Plugins.dat` file conflicts.

* 1.0.94 -- 2020-04-10
  * Fix #29 by supporting data reader files with `.cljs` and `.cljc` extensions as well as `.clj`.
  * As of 1.1.117, this is the default and there is a new `-D` / `--debug-clash` option to display these warnings: _Address #28 by adding `-S` / `--suppress-clash` option to suppress the warning about clashing jar items._
  * Move to MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS versioning scheme.
